# U-of-T-Hacks
Our hackathon project for Uoft Hacks 3. Visit particleparty.me for the final project. The website is meant to act as a home/landing page for your webbroswer built almost entirely out of JS. The idea is to have a styleish customizable home page where you can display time, weather etc. and also have it be interactable and fun.
